Walk north for two hours, turn left at the tall trees, walk east for twenty minutes, 
continue straight ahead, cross the stream, turn right onto the main
 road, go through the hole in the fence, walk under the bridge 
(watch out for the troll), and then three miles inside the forest,
 you will find some mushrooms under a tree. Go now so you can be back in time for dinner.
